# The `pixelcurio` TD Toolbox Project

This is a collection of Python scripts, various coding development configs, and how-tos that is meant to be a modest, but hopefully useful, resource for those doing pipeline development in the Animation or VFX industries.

All of the material included in this project has been gathered from the work I've done between gigs on my own personal projects, where I hone my TD (Technical Director) pipeline chops by rewriting things from scratch based on what I've learned from my work in real production environments.
