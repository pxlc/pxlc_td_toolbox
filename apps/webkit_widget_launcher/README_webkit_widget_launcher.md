# Webkit Widget based launcher

This is an older project that I'm adding in here for reference, and for anyone interested in leveraging their web developer skills in building or expanding a launcher with the main UI elements running within a QWebKit widget.

I abandoned this approach as moving from PySide 1.2.x or Qt4 to PySide 2.x or Qt5, the webkit support changes a bunch (and I haven't bothered to look into what changes I would need to make to move things forward). Also, I was starting to forget all of my Qt widget knowledge!
